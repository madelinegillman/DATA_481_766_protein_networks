#1 - Distribution of Trash Types - Bar chart displaying the total count of different types of trash collected, highlighting the most common waste items.

#2 - Seasonal Trends in Trash Collection - Line chart showing how the total weight of collected trash varies across different months, indicating seasonal patterns.

#3 - Proportion of Trash Types - Pie chart illustrating the relative proportions of various trash types, helping visualize which types contribute the most to overall waste.

#4 - Correlation Between Trash Types - Correlation matrix heatmap revealing relationships between different types of trash, showing which items tend to appear together.
