# DATA_481_766

### Welcome to the team repo for DATA 481/766!

This is a class led by Professor Steve Marron at UNC - Chapel Hill. The class is divided into teams--each with 4-5 undergraduate students (data analysts) and 1 graduate student (team lead). We are team Protein Networks working with protein immunofluorescence data generated by the Brunk and Pervis labs at UNC-CH. We have a [team charter](https://github.com/madelinegillman/DATA_481_766_protein_networks/blob/main/Team_Charter.docx) that guides how our team will work together.

This repository contains two sets of analyses.

### üóëÔ∏è Mr. Trash Wheel analysis

Mr. Trash Wheel is a project started in Baltimore in 2014. More information on this dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-03-05/readme.md). To start flexing our data analysis skills, each undergraduate student conducted an exploratory data analysis and generated data visualizations (scripts for those can be found in their personal directories). After, a "team consensus" document was selected. The team consensus documents are for [reading in](https://github.com/madelinegillman/DATA_481_766_protein_networks/blob/main/01_make_data.Rmd) and summarizing the data set, [exploratory data analysis,](https://github.com/madelinegillman/DATA_481_766_protein_networks/blob/main/02_EDA.Rmd) and [data visualization](https://github.com/madelinegillman/DATA_481_766_protein_networks/blob/main/03_killergraph.Rmd).

### üî¨ Protein networks analysis

Building off [prior work](https://github.com/Brunk-Lab/Digital_Upskilling_Level_3/blob/main/Protein_Networks_for_Data_Science_Students.ipynb) in the Brunk lab, we are using the protein immunofluorescence data to 1) understand protein relationships with HER2 and 2) Create a classifier to classify cells into HER2 low/high groups.

This analysis can be found in the [protein_networks](https://github.com/madelinegillman/DATA_481_766_protein_networks/tree/main/protein_networks) directory.
