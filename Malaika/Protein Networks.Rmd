```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Set Up

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)        # Helps load, explore, and manipulate data tables
library(ggplot2)      # Makes it easy to create beautiful and informative plots
library(stats)        # Provides statistical tools for analyzing data (built-in with R)
library(ggpubr)       # Adds statistical annotations like p-values to plots
library(data.table)   # For fast data manipulation (optional)

# Optional: Configure options to display more rows and columns
options(dplyr.print_max = 500)       # Display up to 500 rows
options(dplyr.width = Inf)           # Display all columns without truncation

# Optional: Set a nice default theme for plots
theme_set(theme_bw())                # Equivalent to seaborn's "whitegrid"

# Confirm to students that everything is ready
cat("All libraries are imported, and we're ready to go!\n")
```
```{r}
# Load the dataset for the H2170 lung cancer cell line
# We call its container "df_cell", which stands for dataFrame of the cell line that holds all of the single-cell protein measurements
df_cell <- read.csv('lung_cancer.csv', row.names = 1)  # Equivalent to index_col=0 in Python

# Display the first few rows to ensure it loaded correctly
cat("Dataset loaded successfully! Here are the first few rows:\n")
head(df_cell)

```
